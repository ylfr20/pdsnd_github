### Date created
The bikeshare project was created on 26th July 2020; the README file was created on 2nd August 2020.

### Project Description
In this project, I used python to explore data on bikesharing information from three selected US cities - Chicago, New York and Washington. The codes calculate certain **descriptive statistics** based on the interactive inputs given by the user. The script is written in Python 3 and can be executed in a Python IDE (e.g. Spyder).

### Descriptive Statistics
The codes will provide statistics on:
- Time of rental
- Station
- Trip duration
- User
... and exhibit raw data depending on user's request.

### Files used
Files that are used in this project include:
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv

### Credits
I have referred to following sources for solving some of the tasks:

- To produce the display options to show raw data: https://github.com/synflyn28/udacity-bikeshare
- Stackoverflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4048651/python-function-to-convert-seconds-into-minutes-hours-and-days/4048773)
- Pandas documentation on Series and DataFrame
- Notes/examples from lecture contents and practice problems within the nano degree program
